# Baseball-Bonanza

Are you ready to play BASEBALL BONANZA?

This is a fun (not-so-realistic) baseball simulation game where the user competes against a computer opponent (sort of) and tries to score as many runs as possible to win. Your sole responsibility is hitting the ball. Sounds easy? Try the extreme difficulty level!

This was a self-directed final project for my Foundations of Computer Science class in senior year of high school. It's my first ever project so the code isn't all that pretty, but the game turned out quite well.

The original images used in the game have been lost, but I was either able to refind the images or find suitable replacements for everything except the bat.

I've also found that text displays differently between operating systems, so if it looks a little too big on your computer, that's why.

Have fun playing!
